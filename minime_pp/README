Requires:

fftw3

Linux:
Built fftw from source (http://www.fftw.org/) or install it via the repository, e.g. on Ubuntu via
sudo apt-get install fftw3
Linking is done as:
-lfftw3

Windows:

1) Build fftw from source via MSYS. The routine follows the typical ./configure ./make procedure. You'll find the build files in the local folder of MSYS.
Just copy and paste them from there into the global include, lib and bin folder if you like. The *.dll goes into the bin, the .a (if any) goes into the lib and the header has to be copied
into the include folder.

2) Download the binaries from http://www.fftw.org/.
The *.dll goes into the bin folder of your compiler. The GL folder goes into the include folder of your compiler.
When using mingw64 as a compiler suite for Windows, make sure that the GL folder sits in e.g. mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include
and not mingw64\include.
The *.a finally goes into mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib (again, assuming the mingw64 suite) folder.

Linking should be done as follows:
-lfreeglut -glu32 -opengl32
Please notice than when building freeglut from source, you have to rename the first linker to -lglut.
