Requires
--------

freeglut

Linux
-----

Build freeglut from source (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download) or install it via the repository, e.g. on Ubuntu via
> sudo apt-get install

Linking is done as (refer to the Makefile):
-lGL -lGLU -lglut

Windows
-------

Two possible approaches:

1) Build freeglut from source via MSYS. The routine follows the typical
> ./configure
> make
procedure. You'll find the build files in the local folder of MSYS.
Just copy and paste them from there into the global include, lib and bin folder if you like. The .dll goes into the bin, the .a goes into the lib and the complete GL folder has to be copied into the include folder.

2) Download the binaries from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download for Windows. The *.dll goes into the bin folder of your compiler. The GL folder goes into the include folder of your compiler. When using mingw64 as a compiler suite for Windows, make sure that the GL folder sits in e.g. mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include and *not* mingw64\include. The *.a finally goes into mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib (again, assuming the mingw64 suite) folder.

Linking should be done as follows (refer to the Makefile):
-lfreeglut -glu32 -opengl32
Please notice than when building freeglut from source, you have to rename the first linker to -lglut if you don't change the naming scheme in the Makefile.
