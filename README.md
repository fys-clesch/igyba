igyba is an open source project for profiling laser beams with CCD or CMOS cameras. It includes
  - live parameter estimation
  - a 3D viewer for live visualization of the input
  - image manipulation and data export
  - a graphical user interface
  - access to Thorlabs (R) cameras

It was written in a modular way, such that other cameras can be implemented along the existing module.
