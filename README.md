igyba is an open source project for profiling laser beams with CCD or CMOS cameras. It includes
  - live parameter estimation
  - a 3D viewer for live visualization of the input
  - image manipulation and data export
  - a graphical user interface
  - access to Thorlabs (R) cameras
  - Linux and Windows support

It was written in a modular way, such that other cameras can be implemented along the existing module.

Projects and libraries used:
  - OpenCV for linear algebra and data structuring
  - freeglut for visualization in OpenGL
  - wxWidgets for the GUI
  - mingw-std-threads for C++11 thread support on Windows
  - OpenMP for multi core data processing in fit routines
  - gnuplot (if available on the machine) for plotting image captures
