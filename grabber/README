Windows:
In short (assuming you have a compiler like mingw64):
- Download OpenCV and CMake
- Add CMake to your path
- Configure OpenCV with CMake for MinGW make
- Generate the build
- use mingw32-make in the folder where the binaries are to be build
- invoke mingw32-make install
- collect all the stuff from the install folder
- if you like, call mingw32-make clean
